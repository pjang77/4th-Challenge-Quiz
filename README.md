# 4th-Challenge-Quiz

I was able to create a functional quiz that starts when you load the page.
It starts a countdown from 60 seconds and takes 10 seconds off every time the user picks the wrong answer.
After they click any choice the quiz will proceed to the next question.
The game over screen will populate when the user finishes the quiz or runs out of time.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
